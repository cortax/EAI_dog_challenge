# Classifying Stanford dogs breeds 

## Data preparation
The "Stanford Dogs Dataset" contains over 20,000 pictures of dogs grouped into subfolders, one per breed. To avoid loading the whole dataset in memory, we use a flow_from_directory as our image generator. We need one flow_from_directory generator for the training set and one flow_from_directory generator for the test set. This requires spliting the data into training and testing beforehand. The function doing this work only requires the spliting ratio as input and will deterministically the first files for training and the rest for testing. One it's done, flow_from_directory generators can be used easily.
